description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

In this module, we will cover:


- [Populations and Samples](#populations-and-samples)
- [Pictorial and Tabular Methods](#pictorial-and-tabular-methods)
- [Measures of Location](#measures-of-location)
- [Measures of Variability](#measures-of-variability)

### Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Calculate some descriptive statistics (Mean, Median, Percentiles, Variance and Standard Deviation) and construct a histogram given a set of univariate data.
- Understand the difference between measures of location and measures of variability.
- Construct a scatter plot of bivariate data and a box plot of univariate data.

## Summary

#### Fundamental Concepts
**Data:** Observations (measurements, counts, or categories) collected for study

**Population:** The entire collection of elements (individuals, objects, or measurements) under study

**Sample:** A subset of the population selected for analysis.

**Variable:** A characteristic of an element that can assume different values

**Observation (Measurement):** The value of a variable for a particular element.

**Quantitative Data:** Measurements expressed numerically (counts or amounts)

**Qualitative (Categorical) Data:** Measurements classified by labels or categories

**Univariate Data:** Data consisting of one variable measured on each element

**Bivariate Data:** Data consisting of two variables measured on each element

**Multivariate Data:** Data consisting of more than two variables measured on each element

#### Graphical Methods (Displaying Data)
**Frequency Distribution:** A tabular summary of data showing the number (frequency) of observations in each category or interval.

**Relative Frequency:** The proportion of the total number of observations falling into a class

$$
Relative Frequency = \frac{Frequency of Class​}{Total Number of Observations}
$$

**Histogram:** A bar-type graph showing frequencies (or relative frequencies) for classes of quantitative data; adjacent bars touch.

**Stem-and-Leaf Display:** A table where each observation is split into a “stem” (leading digits) and a “leaf” (final digit), showing the distribution while preserving data values.

**Dotplot:** A simple display placing a dot above a number line for each data value, stacking dots for repeated values.

**Boxplot (or Box-and-Whisker Plot):** A graphical summary based on the five-number summary (min, Q1, median, Q3, max); shows spread, skewness, and outliers.

**Scatterplot:** A plot of paired bivariate data points on an xy-plane, useful for studying relationships between two variables.
